                "summary": "Although security is a crucial aspect for any application, its implementation can be difficult.\r\nWorse, it is often neglected, poorly implemented and intrusive in the code. But lately, security servers has appeared  which allow to outsource and delegate all authentication and authorization aspects, such as https://auth0.com/. Of these servers, one of the most promising is KeyCloak, open-source, flexible and agnostic of any technology, it is easily deployable / adaptable in its own infrastructure.\r\nIn this session, I propose you to discover KeyCloak progressivly and in an interactive way: 0 slide, 100% live coding. \r\nFrom securing an \"old school\" Java EE app, a Node.js Microservice to a standalone Angular Web App Angular or even a mobile app, all aspects of KeyCloak will be demonstrated. This will also include how to integrate social login, enable Single Sign On or how to bridge to existing identity providers (LDAP, ActiveDirectory). "
