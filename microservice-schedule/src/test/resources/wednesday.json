We’ll look at languages like Scala and Clojure, libraries like Spark and Akka, and various reactive programming techniques like futures and actors. Then, we’ll see how we can go beyond the JVM to interact with innovative techniques implemented in other runtimes, such as deep learning in Python.</p>\n<p>The examples will be taken from real-world use cases such as fraud detection, autonomous cars, and intelligent agents.

                "lang": "en",
                "summary": "Reactive machine learning is a set of techniques for building production-grade machine learning systems that stay responsive in the face of failure or changes in load. Drawing on principles outlined in the Reactive Manifesto, the reactive approach to machine learning gives us a principled way of building large scale machine learning systems that are every bit as good as modern web apps.\r\n\r\nThis talk will explore how reactive machine learning systems can be built on the JVM. We’ll look at languages like Scala and Clojure, libraries like Spark and Akka, and various reactive programming techniques like futures and actors. Then, we’ll see how we can go beyond the JVM to interact with innovative techniques implemented in other runtimes, such as deep learning in Python. \r\n\r\nThe examples will be taken from real-world use cases such as fraud detection, autonomous cars, and intelligent agents. But they will be transformed into the exciting world of cartoon animals who do machine learning. Kangaroos, turtles, rabbits, and more will guide us through the wild world of reactive machine learning."

What you need is \"just enough app server\" to support only the subset of APIs and services your application needs.\r\n\r\nIn this session I will make an inventory of Java EE application servers (Weblogic, Websphere, JBoss, GlassFish), Profile Web (Tomee, Payara, Siwpass) and Servlets (Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow). If Microservices is want you want, I will introduce other modular solutions such as WildFly Swarm, KumuluzEE, Spring Boot or Dropwizard. I will talk about performance, war, executable jar, monitoring, management, optimization, use cases and some personal feedback... all this by showing code and executing several types of applications (from the simplest to more complex) in several kinds of containers ... and maybe even on a Raspberry Pi."
