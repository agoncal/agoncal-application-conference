In this presentation we will build a simple robot and connect to it remotely, receiving data and sending instructions over the internet. Just like the Pathfinder spacecraft and it’s Sojourner Mars rover, our little robot will boldly travel into uncharted territory.\r\nIn a live demo, our robot will explore the session room and transmit all kinds of sensor data. We will visualise that data in a web UI. \r\n\r\nWith the Mars robot use case, we explore the capabilities of the Amazon IoT platform. AWS IoT comes with easy to use APIs and arranges secure communication with our robot. It also provides neat features like a rules engine and ‘device shadow’. Even when our robot is offline, device shadow makes it very easy to retrieve its latest status. And last but not least, for small scale use, AWS IoT is totally free. \r\nAre you curious about how to connect your devices to the cloud? Take this journey and find out if this mission will lead to new discoveries."},"fromTime":"10:50","toTimeMillis":1478775000000,"toTime":"11:50","roomCapacity":372,"roomName":"Room 6","slotId":"conf_room6_thursday_10_10h50_11h50","day":"thursday"},{"roomId":"room7","notAllocated":false,"fromTimeMillis":1478771400000,"break":null,"roomSetup":"theatre","talk":{"trackId":"bigdata","talkType":"Conference","track":"Big Data","summaryAsHtml":"<p>Apache Kafka was created at LinkedIn as a resilient and scalable distributed commit log providing a traditional publish / subscribe interface.

And there’s a reason for that: the high-demand and high-scale distributed world that we have today, reacting to events in an asynchronous and non-blocking fashion seems the right approach to deal with scalability. And to achieve microservices you need a lightweight, fast, modular, high-performance and un-opinionated environment. Meet Vert.x: a toolkit for building reactive applications on the JVM.\r\n\r\nCome to this session to see how you can use Vert.x to create reactive code using Java, Groovy, JavaScript or other JVM languages. We’ll demonstrate how to build Vert.x-based systems leveraging the unique Vert.x event bus for creating apps with real-time communications from the modern web browser to the cloud and back again. Have fun with a large number of live demonstrations that will cause you to reconsider your reliance on monoliths and consider leaving tradition behind for an event-driven, reactive, microservice-focused architecture."},"fromTime":"17:50","toTimeMillis":1478800200000,"toTime":"18:50","roomCapacity":347,"roomName":"Room 4","slotId":"conf_room4_thursday_10_17h50_18h50","day":"thursday"},{"roomId":"room3","notAllocated":false,"fromTimeMillis":1478796600000,"break":null,"roomSetup":"theatre","talk":{"trackId":"lang","talkType":"Conference","track":"Programming languages","summaryAsHtml":"<p>Scala, by being both Functional and Object-Oriented is easy to get started\nwith, especially for java developpers.
