But before looking at those, it is crucial to take a step back and understand what is the blockchain, what it brings to the table and what it will enable in the near future. In this talk, we will come back to the source of this technology and explain why it is likely to change everybody's lives and create a whole new range of opportunities for developers, way beyond the traditional crypto-currency universe, from education to democracy, going through identity and the very notion of work."

In this session we will discuss the fundamental algorithms behind neural networks, and develop an intuition for how to train a deep neural network using large data sets. We will then use the algorithms we have developed to train a simple handwritten digit recognizer, and illustrate how to generalize this technique to different images. In the second and final part, we will show you how to apply the same algorithms using DL4J, a Spark-based Java library for deep learning. You will learn how to implement a neural network, monitor it's training progress and test its accuracy over time. Prior experience with Java and some basic algebra is a pre-requirement."

So you are a Java developer but how comfortable are you and your team taking Docker from development to production? Are you hearing developers say, “But it works on my machine!” when code breaks in production? And if you are, how many hours are then spent standing up an accurate test environment to research and fix the bug that caused the problem?\r\n\r\nDocker provides PODA (Package Once Deploy Anywhere) and complements WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere) provided by Java. It also helps you reduce the impedance mismatch between dev, test, and production environment and simplifies Java application deployment.\r\n\r\nThis workshop/session explains how to package, deploy, and scale Java applications using Docker."

        "summary": "Do this, do that. Coding from assembler to shell scripting, from the mainstream languages of the last century to the mainstream languages now, is dominated by an imperative style. From how we teach variables — they vary, right? — to how we talk about databases, we are constantly looking at state as a thing to be changed and programming languages are structured in terms of the mechanics of change — assignment, loops and how code can be threaded (cautiously) with concurrency. \r\n\r\nFunctional programming, mark-up languages, schemas, persistent data structures and more are all based around a more declarative approach to code, where instead of reasoning in terms of who does what to whom and what the consequences are, relationships and uses are described, and the flow of execution follows from how functions, data and other structures are composed. This talk will look at the differences between imperative and declarative approaches, offering lessons, habits and techniques that are applicable from requirements through to code and tests in Java and other languages."

We wanted to look at Cognitive Search, hook it up to a library of videos and articles we’ve published over the years, and try to make something better than what is already around.\r\n\r\nRecently we started hacking and want to share what we did - hopefully some of you will help take it further.\r\n\r\nWe’ll walk you through the project so far, using Watson Speech to text and Concept Insights APIs to build a cognitive engine to find technical videos and articles in a corpus we’ve created. And we’ll ask whether Concept Insights helped us make better decisions when analyzing quantities of unstructured data.\r\n\r\nWe’ve only scratched the surface. More tech, sources and ideas need to be plugged in, and we’ll iterate between Devoxx conferences in different locations. Come and hear what we could do, what we’ve managed so far, and how to get your hands on the code.\r\n\r\nSome of the Watson API’s we’ve been playing with are at: https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/watson.html"

You will also witness a demonstration of these principles in action, with live coding of Serenity BDD automated tests, and see how Serenity BDD turns the Screenplay tests into living documentation.\r\n\r\nWhile the demonstration will be in Java and will use the open source Serenity BDD library, the Screenplay pattern can be applied to any language or framework."

But now CDI 2.0 is Here (like the same Winter) and all the new stuff it brings will deeply change your Java EE, MicroProfile and Java SE experience.\r\nIn this session I will review the major features introduced in CDI 2.0 and I'll demonstrate how  it can be used in various environment like Java EE 7 application server, MicroProfile platform or even Java SE. \r\nIf you still think that CDI is a simple Dependency Injection solution bound to Java EE or think that there's only one platform to bootstrap advanced service on Java SE, come and see that the CDI \"Winter\" can compete with \"Spring\"."

But what about the user interface? How are we supposed to structure what is arguably the most important part of our applications – the one facing our users? In this session we’ll explore the role of the UI aspect in a microservice architecture, look at various methods of modularization, and derive a set of guidelines for avoiding monolithic frontends."
